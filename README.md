# Les-Voix-de-L-Exil

**Interactive narrative project developed during the first year of a web development curriculum (team of 3).**

🎮 *Interactive branching narrative* created as part of a school assignment.  
🛠️ I led the project and handled the majority of the development.  
🚀 Deployed on [Render](https://les-voix-de-l-exil.onrender.com) to showcase both the result and my autonomy.
